# Structure

## 📖 Detailed overview

Structure is a component for forming a block with content. Unlike Section, here you can
form an internal structure from cells. Structure consists of an external and internal
containers for other widgets. For the inner container, you can specify the maximum and
minimum width, as well as the number of cells for the content and the number of unique
cells in the pattern. The cell behavior is configured in the Layout section by the Grid
properties of a StructureContent component. The cells themselves can be styled using the
properties of the Grid Child section.

### About the Pattern

Pattern is a group of different repeated cells. For example, you can make a pattern of
two cells with different styling and if the total number is 8, then the odd part will
be styled like the first cell, and the even part like the second cell. This is designed
so to create interesting structure and content design solutions.
